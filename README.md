Practicing git and github
I believe that practice makes perfect. However practicing the wrong will also makes perfect in doing the wrong thing.
I will therefore say, practicing the right thing will makes you perfect in doing the  correct things.
I will continue to practice the right thing untill I become perfect and get the  right job with high pay.
